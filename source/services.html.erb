    <h2 class="service-title">Handcrafted Websites</h2>

    <p>Your business is unique. It stands apart from its competitors in meaningful ways that need to be communicated clearly and concisely to your customers, clients and prospects. Generic templates and do-it-yourself software either do not have what you need, or are so complex they become unreasonably time consuming to learn.</p>

    <p>This is where Cascading Media steps in. Our business centers around converting your business objectives into professionally crafted websites that look great and perform beautifully across all major desktop browsers, tablet computers and smart phones.</p>

    <h2 class="service-title">Web Applications</h2>

    <p>There are two classes of websites we can build for your business &#8211; <em>Sites</em> and <em>Web Applications</em>. Sites are appropriate for small quantities of content that do not need to be updated very often. The advantages of sites include:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Custom page layouts based on your content.</li>
    <li>Faster load times.</li>
    <li>Higher level of security (no server-side code or database to hack).</li>
    <li>Lower cost of construction and maintenance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The primary disadvantage of sites are their technical limitations, which brings us to web applications. A web application changes or customizes itself frequently and automatically. Dynamic pages are generated by server-side scripts that pull information from a database and then compile the results into standard HTML and CSS that web browsers understand.</p>

    <p>If anyone needs to sign into your website, Cascading Media classifies it as a web application. If no one needs to sign in, we classify it as a site. In other words, sites provide one-way communication, site to users, and web applications have the ability to listen and then respond to individual users.</p>

    <p>Please see the <%= link_to("Technologies", "web-technologies.html") %> page for technical information describing how Cascading Media builds sites and web applications.</p>

    <h2 class="service-title">Email Newsletters</h2>

    <p>Once your website is live on Cascading Cloud, it is time to spread the word with an email newsletter. A newsletter that has been handcrafted to match the style, tone and message of your brand can drive targeted traffic to your website that quickly converts to increased awareness, revenue or any number of business objectives.</p>

    <h3>Any Device or Mail Client</h3>

    <p>Your subscribers read your emails on a broad range of devices using a countless number of mail clients. This is why we craft your HTML newsletters so they can be read anywhere on any device. Gone are the days where you had to choose between Outlook and optimization for smartphones and tablets. Cascading Media uses a solid grid system that blends flexibility and stability so your readers can view your newsletters perfectly, from wherever they might be.</p>

    <h2>Current Rates</h2>

    <p>Cascading Media tries to be as straight forward with pricing as possible. The table below outlines our current rates. Blocks of time are reserved in advance and assigned to specific dates. To reserve a block of time, we ask for a deposit equalling 50% of the rate. The second 50% is invoiced after the block has been used.</p>
